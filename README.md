# Introduction
Juvavum, Domino Juvavum and Cram are impartial, [combinatorical games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory) played on an m x n board.

* In [Cram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram_(game)), two players have a collection of dominoes which they place on the board in turn. Each domino must always cover two squares of the board which are not yet covered by any other domino.
* Domino Juvavum has the same rules except that in every move a player is allowed to put an arbitrary number of dominoes (at least one) in the same row or column.
* Juvavum has the same rules as Domino Juvavum, except that instead of dominoes (which cover two adjacent squares) the players use coins (which cover one square each).

The player who makes the last move wins. In the mis√®re version, the first player who cannot move wins.

Cram has been popularised by [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner). Juvavum and Domino Juvavum have been introduced by [Peter Gerl](https://petergerl-mathematiker.tumblr.com) at the University of Salzburg.
